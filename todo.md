# Gemini Scheduler - Action Plan ‚úÖ COMPLETED

This document outlined the steps for building the Gemini Scheduler, a web-based application for scheduling, running, and monitoring AI agent jobs. **All phases have been completed successfully with additional enhancements.**

## Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Initial Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Initialize a root Node.js project (`npm init -y`).
- [x] Create a `backend` directory for the server-side code.
- [x] Initialize a Node.js project within the `backend` directory (`cd backend && npm init -y`).
- [x] Install backend dependencies: `express`, `node-cron`, `better-sqlite3`, and `cors`.
- [x] Create a `frontend` directory for the client-side application.
- [x] Scaffold a React + TypeScript project in the `frontend` directory using Vite (`npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts`).
- [x] Install frontend dependencies: `axios` for API communication and timeline visualization components.

## Phase 2: Backend - Database and API Development ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Create a database initialization script (`backend/src/database/setup.js`).
    - [x] Define the schema for a `jobs` table (e.g., `id`, `name`, `cron_schedule`, `prompt`, `is_active`).
    - [x] Define the schema for a `job_runs` table (e.g., `id`, `job_id`, `status`, `output`, `start_time`, `end_time`).
- [x] Set up the main Express server file (`backend/src/index.js`).
- [x] Implement RESTful API endpoints for managing jobs (`/api/jobs`):
    - [x] `GET /`: List all jobs.
    - [x] `POST /`: Create a new job.
    - [x] `PUT /:id`: Update an existing job (e.g., to activate/deactivate it).
    - [x] `DELETE /:id`: Delete a job.
- [x] Implement API endpoints for retrieving job execution history (`/api/job-runs`):
    - [x] `GET /`: List all job runs, with query parameters for filtering by `job_id`, `status`, and time range.

## Phase 3: Backend - Core Scheduling Logic ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Create a scheduler service module (`backend/src/scheduler.js`).
- [x] On application startup, the scheduler service loads all active jobs from the database.
- [x] For each active job, use `node-cron` to schedule its execution based on its `cron_schedule`.
- [x] When a job is triggered by the scheduler:
    - [x] Use `child_process.exec` to run the job's specified prompt with `gemini-cli` (e.g., `gemini-cli --prompt "<prompt_text>"`).
    - [x] Create a new record in the `job_runs` table with a status of `'running'`.
    - [x] Capture all `stdout` and `stderr` from the executed command.
    - [x] Upon completion, update the corresponding `job_runs` record with a final status (`'success'` or `'failure'`), the complete output, and the end time.
- [x] Implement dynamic scheduling to add, remove, and update jobs in `node-cron` without needing to restart the server, triggered by API calls.

## Phase 4: Frontend - Job Management UI ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Design and implement a main layout component for the application.
- [x] Create a `JobForm` component to allow users to create and edit jobs. This form includes inputs for the job name, schedule selection, and a textarea for the free-text prompt.
- [x] Implement client-side validation for the form, especially for the schedule format.
- [x] Create a `JobsList` component that displays all configured jobs, with controls for editing and deleting them.

## Phase 5: Frontend - Timeline Visualization and Output Display ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Develop the main `TimelineView` component, which is the default view of the application.
- [x] Fetch job run data from the `/api/job-runs` endpoint.
- [x] Create a custom timeline visualization to render the job runs visually.
    - [x] Each job run is represented as an item on the timeline.
    - [x] The items are color-coded based on their status (e.g., green for success, red for failure, yellow for running).
    - [x] The label for each item is the name of the job.
- [x] Add visual enhancements like hover effects and better typography.
- [x] Implement the primary feature: a "details" view for job run output.
    - [x] When a user clicks on a job run in the timeline, a modal appears.
    - [x] This view prominently and clearly displays the full, captured `output` of the job run.

## Phase 6: Integration, Build, and Documentation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Configure the Vite development server to proxy `/api` requests to the backend Express server to avoid CORS issues.
- [x] Create a unified build and start process.
    - [x] Add a `build` script to the frontend `package.json` to compile the React app.
    - [x] Configure the Express server to serve the static frontend files from the `frontend/dist` directory in a production environment.
- [x] Write a comprehensive `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to set up the development environment, run the application, and use its features.
